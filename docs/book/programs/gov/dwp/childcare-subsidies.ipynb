    "### Financial support\n",
    "\n",
    "The program provides up to £2,000 per year for each eligible child to support various childcare arrangements. For children with disabilities, the support is enhanced to £4,000 annually. This support is distributed quarterly, with standard payments capped at £500 per three months per child, while disabled children can receive up to £1,000 per three months.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "The tax-free childcare scheme is designed to provide financial support through a government contribution system. The key operational features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For every £8 deposited by parents into their designated childcare account, the government contributes an additional £2  \n",
    "* The scheme can be used simultaneously with other government childcare initiatives, specifically the 15 or 30 hours free childcare programs, provided eligibility requirements are met for both schemes  \n",
    "* The household income threshold is strictly enforced \\- if either partner's adjusted net income exceeds £100,000 in the current tax year, the family becomes ineligible for the program\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eligibility\n",
    "\n",
    "**Child age requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Children must be under 12 years of age to qualify for the standard scheme. Eligibility automatically terminates on September 1st following the child's 11th birthday. For children with disabilities, the age limit is extended \\- they remain eligible until September 1st following their 16th birthday, provided they receive qualifying disability benefits or are certified as blind or severely sight-impaired.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Work status requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Eligibility is closely tied to employment status. Qualifying work situations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Active employment: Applicants must be currently employed or self-employed  \n",
    "2. Leave status: Individuals on the following types of leave qualify:  \n",
    "   1. Sick leave  \n",
    "   2. Annual leave  \n",

    "   4. Maternity leave  \n",
    "   5. Paternity leave  \n",
    "   6. Adoption leave  \n",
    "3. Return to work: Applicants must be returning to work within 31 days of their initial application date\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-working individual eligibility**\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheme recognizes certain circumstances where one partner may not be working. Eligibility can be maintained if one partner is employed while the other receives any of the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Incapacity benefit  \n",
    "* Severe disablement allowance  \n",
    "* Carer's allowance (with special provision for carer support payment in Scotland)  \n",
    "* Contribution-based employment and support allowance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimum earnings requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheme establishes minimum earning thresholds that must be met by each partner over a three-month period:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ages 21 and over: Minimum earnings of £2,379  \n",
    "* Ages 18-20: Minimum earnings of £1,788  \n",
    "* Under 18 or apprentices: Minimum earnings of £1,331\n",
    "\n",
    "These thresholds are based on national minimum wage or living wage calculations for 16 hours per week on average.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Pension payments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special provisions for self-employed**\n",
    "\n",
    "Newly established self-employed individuals (business less than 12 months old) benefit from more flexible earnings requirements. They may qualify with lower earnings during their initial business period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Income calculations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheme offers flexibility in how income is calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple income sources can be combined to meet the minimum thresholds  \n",
    "* Annual income averaging is permitted (e.g., irregular earnings totaling £9,518 annually can qualify by averaging to £2,379 quarterly)  \n",
    "* Self-employed individuals can choose to use either their total income or solely their self-employment income if it provides eligibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program incompatibilities\n",
    "\n",

    "* Universal credit  \n",
    "* Childcare vouchers or directly contracted childcare\n",

    "\n",
    "Upon successful application:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any existing tax credits will be immediately terminated  \n",
    "* Reapplication for terminated tax credits is not permitted  \n",
    "* Childcare vouchers or directly contracted childcare must be cancelled within 90 days  \n",
    "* Universal credit claims should only be cancelled after receiving confirmation of tax-free childcare approval  \n",
    "* Childcare bursaries or grants cannot be received simultaneously with tax-free childcare\n",
