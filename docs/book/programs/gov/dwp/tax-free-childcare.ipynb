    "[Official government guidance](https://www.gov.uk/tax-free-childcare?step-by-step-nav=d78aeaf6-1747-4d72-9619-f16efb4dd89d) | [Legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2015/9780111127063)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Tax-free childcare helps working families with childcare costs. For every **£8** paid into a childcare account, the government adds **£2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program provides financial support up to **£2,000** per year (**£500** per quarter) for each eligible child. For disabled children, this support increases to **£4,000** per year (**£1,000** per quarter).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eligibility requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Age criteria\n",
    "Standard childcare support extends until **September 1st** following the child's **11th** birthday. For **disabled children** who receive disability benefits or are certified as **blind/severely sight-impaired**, support continues until **September 1st** following their **16th** birthday.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Income requirements\n",
    "Income thresholds apply at both ends of the spectrum. The maximum adjusted net income allowed is **£100,000** per year for each partner. Minimum earnings requirements (per **3 months**) vary by age:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Age group | Minimum earnings |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **21+** | **£2,379** |\n",
    "| **18-20** | **£1,788** |\n",
    "| **Under 18/Apprentices** | **£1,331** |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Work status\n",
    "Eligible individuals must be either **employed**, **self-employed**, or on qualifying leave (**sick**, **annual**, or **shared parental leave**). Applications can be submitted if starting work within **31 days**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-working partners may still qualify if they receive any of these benefits: **incapacity benefit**, **severe disablement allowance**, **carer's allowance**, or **contribution-based employment and support allowance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional rules\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Income assessment\n",
    "The program offers flexible income assessment:\n",
    "* Combines **multiple income sources**\n",
    "* Allows **annual income averaging**\n",
    "* Gives **self-employed** individuals choice between total or self-employment income\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain types of income are excluded from calculations: **dividends**, **interest**, **property income**, and **pension payments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program interactions\n",
    "Tax-free childcare is compatible with the **15/30 hours free childcare** program but cannot be combined with:\n",
    "* **Working tax credit**\n",
    "* **Child tax credit**\n",
    "* **Universal credit**\n",
    "* **Childcare vouchers** or directly contracted childcare\n",
    "\n",
    "When approved for tax-free childcare:\n",
    "* Existing benefits terminate automatically\n",
    "* Childcare vouchers must be cancelled within **90 days**\n",
    "* **New self-employed** businesses (under **12 months**) benefit from more flexible earnings requirements"

    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following steps, we explain how PolicyEngine models the tax-free childcare program through parameter definitions and calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Age determination\n",
    "   First, we determine which children in the household are age-eligible for the program, as tax-free childcare is only available until specific age thresholds.\n",
    "   * [`standard.yaml`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/16cc0f012bdccd0a20d445aa44b8e47906b04059/policyengine_uk/parameters/gov/hmrc/tax_free_childcare/age/standard.yaml) and [`disability.yaml`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/16cc0f012bdccd0a20d445aa44b8e47906b04059/policyengine_uk/parameters/gov/hmrc/tax_free_childcare/age/disability.yaml) define age thresholds\n",
    "   * [`tax_free_childcare_child_age_eligible.py`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/16cc0f012bdccd0a20d445aa44b8e47906b04059/policyengine_uk/variables/gov/hmrc/tax_free_childcare/conditions/tax_free_childcare_child_age_eligible.py) calculates whether each child meets the standard (11 years) or disability-based (16 years) age requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Income assessment\n",
    "   After identifying eligible children, we evaluate if the parents meet the income criteria, which includes both minimum and maximum thresholds.\n",
    "   * [`countable_sources.yaml`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/16cc0f012bdccd0a20d445aa44b8e47906b04059/policyengine_uk/parameters/gov/hmrc/tax_free_childcare/income/countable_sources.yaml) specifies which income types count (employment and self-employment)\n",
    "   * [`income_limit.yaml`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/16cc0f012bdccd0a20d445aa44b8e47906b04059/policyengine_uk/parameters/gov/hmrc/tax_free_childcare/income/income_limit.yaml) sets the £100,000 maximum threshold\n",
    "   * [`minimum_weekly_hours.yaml`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/16cc0f012bdccd0a20d445aa44b8e47906b04059/policyengine_uk/parameters/gov/hmrc/tax_free_childcare/minimum_weekly_hours.yaml) defines the 16-hour work requirement\n",
    "   * [`tax_free_childcare_meets_income_requirements.py`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/16cc0f012bdccd0a20d445aa44b8e47906b04059/policyengine_uk/variables/gov/hmrc/tax_free_childcare/conditions/tax_free_childcare_meets_income_requirements.py) uses these to calculate:\n",
    "     - Total eligible income from countable sources\n",
    "     - Quarterly income requirements\n",
    "     - Compliance with maximum thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Program compatibility\n",
    "   We then check if the household receives any benefits that would make them ineligible for tax-free childcare, as certain benefits cannot be claimed alongside it.\n",
    "   * [`disqualifying_benefits.yaml`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/16cc0f012bdccd0a20d445aa44b8e47906b04059/policyengine_uk/parameters/gov/hmrc/tax_free_childcare/disqualifying_benefits.yaml) lists incompatible benefits\n",
    "   * [`tax_free_childcare_program_eligible.py`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/16cc0f012bdccd0a20d445aa44b8e47906b04059/policyengine_uk/variables/gov/hmrc/tax_free_childcare/conditions/tax_free_childcare_program_eligible.py) checks if the household receives any disqualifying benefits like Working Tax Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Work status\n",
    "   The program requires parents to be working, so we verify employment status with special provisions for couples where one partner has a disability.\n",
    "   * [`tax_free_childcare_work_condition.py`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/16cc0f012bdccd0a20d445aa44b8e47906b04059/policyengine_uk/variables/gov/hmrc/tax_free_childcare/conditions/tax_free_childcare_work_condition.py) evaluates:\n",
    "     - Single parents: must be working\n",
    "     - Couples: either both working or one working with partner receiving disability benefits\n",
    "     - Links with disability benefit variables to confirm eligibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Final eligibility\n",
    "   Now we combine all previous eligibility checks to determine if the household qualifies for the program overall.\n",
    "   * [`tax_free_childcare_eligibility.py`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/16cc0f012bdccd0a20d445aa44b8e47906b04059/policyengine_uk/variables/gov/hmrc/tax_free_childcare/tax_free_childcare_eligibility.py) combines:\n",
    "     - Age eligibility results\n",
    "     - Income requirement checks\n",
    "     - Program compatibility verification\n",
    "     - Work condition compliance\n",
    "   * Determines overall program eligibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Contribution amount\n",
    "   Finally, for eligible households, we calculate the amount of support they can receive based on the number and status of qualifying children.\n",
    "   * [`standard_child.yaml`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/16cc0f012bdccd0a20d445aa44b8e47906b04059/policyengine_uk/parameters/gov/hmrc/tax_free_childcare/contribution/standard_child.yaml) and [`disabled_child.yaml`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/16cc0f012bdccd0a20d445aa44b8e47906b04059/policyengine_uk/parameters/gov/hmrc/tax_free_childcare/contribution/disabled_child.yaml) define maximum benefits\n",

    "     - Identifies eligible children\n",
    "     - Applies appropriate rate (£2,000 or £4,000 yearly)\n",
    "     - Ensures quarterly caps (£500 or £1,000)\n",
