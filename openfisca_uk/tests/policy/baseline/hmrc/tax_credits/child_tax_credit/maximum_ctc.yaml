    # This result is from entitledto.co.uk. GOV.UK (https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/tax-credits-calculator) 
    # estimates a lower entitlement (£851.30 every four weeks, £212.83 per week), but this 
    # is possibly incorrect, since it asks for less information (only total numbers of children
    # in each category, not characteristics of individual children like entitledto.
